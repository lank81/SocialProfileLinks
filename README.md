## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

The continual addition of small increments of learning has really made this fun, useful, and expedited my learning.  Having to create different shapes (circle image) and different but similar layouts has really helped with my confidence as I continue to learn front development.
